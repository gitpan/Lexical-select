NAME
    Lexical::select - provides a lexically scoped currently selected
    filehandle

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
      use Lexical::select;

      open my $fh, '>', 'fubar' or die "Oh noes!\n";

      {
        my $lxs = lselect $fh;

        print "Something wicked goes to \$fh \n";

      }

      print "Back on STDOUT\n";

DESCRIPTION
    Changing the currently selected filehandle with "select" and changing it
    back to the previously selected filehandle can be slightly tedious.
    Wouldn't it be great to have something handle this boilerplate,
    especially in lexical scopes.

    This is where Lexical::select comes in.

    Lexical::select provides the "lselect" function. As demonstrated in the
    "SYNOPSIS", "lselect" will change the currently selected filehandle to
    the filehandle of your choice for the duration of the enclosing lexical
    scope.

FUNCTIONS
    Functions exported by default.

    "lselect"
        Takes one parameter, a "filehandle" that will become the currently
        selected filehandle for the duration of the enclosing scope.

        Returns an object, which provides the "restore" method.

        You can then either "restore" the currently selected filehandle back
        manually or let the object fall out of scope, which automagically
        restores.

METHODS
    "restore"
        Explicitly restores the currently selected filehandle back to the
        original filehandle. This is called automagically when the object is
        "DESTROY"ed, for instance when the object goes out of scope.
